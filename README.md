# speech-recognizer-for-colab
different from normal speech recognizer code as colab is a cloud based service that cant recognize hardware speaker from device



#To make this app work with a live microphone and in a local environment (instead of Colab), you can run the following on your local machine:

Install the libraries with pip:

bash

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio wikipedia
Use the microphone for live speech recognition by replacing the recognize_speech_from_file function with the following for real-time speech recognition:

python

def recognize_speech_from_microphone():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    try:
        print("Recognizing...")
        return recognizer.recognize_google(audio).lower()
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I couldn't understand that.")
        return None
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("Sorry, there was a problem with the speech recognition service.")
        return None
By following this method, you can build a fully functional speech assistant locally and modify the code to run in real-time on your machine. Let me know if you need further help with running it locally!
